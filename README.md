How to use: 
The game plays like tetris, because it is tetris. The left and right arrow keys are used to move the piece from left to right as it falls. You can also use the down arrow key to speed up the piece’s descent. Along with this a player can also press on the Z key to rotate the piece clockwise and on the X key to rotate it counter-clockwise. Finally, a player can also press the C key to put a piece into hold to be swapped out later by the user. The game also tracks the high scores of up to three players. If a player has managed to acquire a score high enough to put on the board, then the player will be prompted for their name, to display on the scoreboard along with their score.

How to use: 
The game plays like tetris, because it is tetris. The left and right arrow keys are used to move the piece from left to right as it falls, while hitting the up arrow key changes the orientation of the piece. You can also use the down arrow key to speed up the piece’s descent. A player can also press the right control to put a piece into hold to be swapped out later by the user. The game also tracks the high scores of up to three players. If a player has managed to acquire a score high enough to put on the board, then the player will be prompted for their name, to display on the scoreboard along with their score.
